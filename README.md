# Art

Welcome to my art page! Machine Learning has a certain aesthetic; imagine networks and robots and brains... My aesthetic is... cuter. I am inspired by computecuter.com where you can find other computing art and objects that are cute! 

## Presentation Slides Art

One of the things that bugs me is not having diverse art for my presentation slides. You can find some png files in the people directory to include in slides! Use  them and just add credit to this github or my name!

## Healing Your Social Media Tips
My other art is about healing your social media through understanding the algorithms, diversifying your feeds, and reconnecting with joy.
